				<hr class="bot-mar-6">
				<p>Fillings are needed to address such problems as cavities, chipped or broken teeth, and damage to teeth as a result of wear.</p> 
				<h2>Materials</h2>
				<p>Filling materials include but are not limited to composite (white fillings), amalgam (silver fillings), gold, ceramic, and others. The majority of fillings I place are composite, but there are occasions when a silver filling is best. Due to its high cost and unnatural look, gold is rarely used any more.
				<h2>Life Expectancy</h2>
				<p>Keep in mind, the life expectancy of different dental materials varies greatly.  Composite fillings have the shortest life expectancy and therefore will need redoing more frequently.  Amalgam (silver) fillings generally last about twice as long as composite.  And gold can last even longer still.</p>
