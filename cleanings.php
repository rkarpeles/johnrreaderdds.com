			<h2>What to Expect</h2>
			<p>For most people, a cleaning consists of polishing your teeth (children), or scaling and polishing for adults. I do not use ultrasonic scalers as I personally find them uncomfortable and noisy. I think I can remove tartar buildup more comfortably by hand. I also do not routinely do fluoride treatments. If indicated, I prefer you use fluoride at home on a regular, even daily basis. This will be far more effective and beneficial to you than an in-office fluoride treatment done once or twice a year.</p>
			<p>Cleanings also include flossing your teeth, as well as discussing areas that need improving. Patients with more significant issues may come in more frequently for cleanings as needed.</p>
