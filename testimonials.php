					<p>I look forward going to the dentist. How many people can say that? Dr. Reader is professional, caring, and has a good sense of humor.  I love that he has a TV to watch sports, news, or a movie from his fine collection of videos.  Dr. Reader is very knowledgeable about dentistry, he has taught myself and my family a thing or two about keeping our teeth in good shape. Dr. Reader is an excellent dentist.</p>

					<p>Dr. John Reader has personally provided expert dental care and advisement for my family since we moved here over 25 years ago. Our children "grew up" under John's gentle care, through fillings, Frankels and orthodontia and today, have the most beautiful smiles I can imagine. Though our children, now grown, have moved on, my wife and I continue under John's thoughtful and trusted care. We have been pleased to refer many of our friends to Dr. Reader who have experienced the same high degree of professional treatment and personal care.</p>

					<p>Dr. Reader has been our family's dentist for over 25 years. In all that time, we could count on his prompt start to each appointment at the scheduled time, easy to understand explanations for any work to be done, and always the feeling that he cares about his patients' comfort and satisfaction with his work. We can't imagine going to anyone else.</p>

					<p>From the very first meeting Dr. Reader's office made me feel comfortable and relaxed. Dr. Reader was suggested to me by a friend. I was glad I went to him. He is honest, friendly, and does not do unnecessary work. When I have had work done he gets it right the first time!</p>

					<p>I have been a patient of Dr. John Reader since 1999.  For about 7 years before that, I had stayed away from dentists because the prior 3 who treated me caused a lot more pain than I would have expected. My children and husband were already Dr. Reader's patients, so I decided to stop being a wimp and try him. Those first few visits were scary for me, but as I learned to trust him, I began looking forward to my 6 month check-ups. Dr. Reader has always been kind and gentle and he does an excellent job of keeping my teeth in good condition. I readily recommend Dr. Reader to friends who are looking for a new dentist. Not only is he a good dentist, Ali does a great job of keeping people informed about their appointments and making the practice run smoothly. Both of them are very nice people who take a personal interest in their patients' lives - that helps make for a good relationship between the patient and the staff. As long as I have teeth, I intend to continue to see Dr. Reader every 6 months! </p>

					<p>I have been a patient of Dr. Reader's for over 20 years.  He is an artist.  This is obvious when one visits his office as his paintings are hanging on the office walls.  He brings his artistic talent to his work in the way of crowns, caps, etc.  He has done beautiful work on my teeth and I definitely recommend him.</p>

					<p>John has been our dentist since moving into the area 10 years ago. He does it all...cleanings, x-rays, orthodontia. All work is 1st class as John is a perfectionist and the best dentist I've had in my 64 years. You will be hard pressed to find a more personable couple than John and his able assistant (and bride) Ali.</p>

					<p>As a faithful patient of Dr. Reader for over 27 years I can attest that since the age of eight, I have always looked forward to visiting the dentist. Each appointment I am greeted with glowing smiles and truly treated as if I were family. I am excited that my children will now have the same great experience at the dentist that I had as a child. Going to the dentist could not be any more enjoyable.</p>

					<p>Here's what I look for in a dentist: expert care and advice, easy to make appointments, enjoyable office visits, and minimal time in the waiting room.  Dr. Reader has consistently delivered on all of those expectations and that's why he's been my dentist for over 25 years.</p>
