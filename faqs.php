				<h3 class="trigger"><a href="#">Do you see children?</a></h3>
				<div class="toggle_container">
					<div class="block">
						<p>Yes, we love our child patients starting at age 3 (younger for emergency needs) and continuing through the teenage years into adulthood. Most adults who have difficulty seeing the dentist usually relate a bad dental experience as a child. This is to be avoided. So we try to make their visits as fun as possible by providing children's videos, prizes, etc.</p>

				<h3 class="trigger"><a href="#">My teeth are sensitive to cold food and beverages. What does this mean?</a></h3>
				<div class="toggle_container">
					<div class="block">
						<p>Sensitive teeth can be from a number of reasons. The most common is due to the gums receding and exposing the root surfaces, which can be sensitive to such things as air, cold, sweets, tooth brushing, etc. </p>
						<p>Sensitive teeth can also indicate a more serious problem such as tooth decay, a cracked tooth, or a nerve problem. A thorough examination including X-rays, thermal testing, bite testing, and transillumination may be needed to identify the cause.</p>

				<h3 class="trigger"><a href="#">It hurts to bite on one of my teeth. Why is this?</a></h3>
				<div class="toggle_container">
					<div class="block">
						<p>The most common cause of pain on biting is a cracked tooth. With examination and testing this can be confirmed. The fix is usually a crown, though sometimes a large filling is possible.</p>
						<p>Another cause of pain on biting could be a tooth whose nerve is dying. In this case root canal therapy or removal is needed.</p>
						<p>A third possible cause is a sinus infection. This can be verified by a thorough history and x-ray.</p>

				<h3 class="trigger"><a href="#">My gums bleed easily. Is this normal?</a></h3>
				<div class="toggle_container">
					<div class="block">
						<p>In most cases the answer is no. Bleeding gums are generally an indication of some level of gum disease or infection. You should be seen by a dentist fairly soon as this can at times progress somewhat rapidly. Bleeding gums can also indicate an underlying medical condition such as diabetes or leukemia. Also, bleeding gums can be related to medications and daily aspirin use.</p>

				<h3 class="trigger"><a href="#">I don't like the look of my teeth and want to improve my smile. What can be done?</a></h3>
				<div class="toggle_container">
					<div class="block">
						<p>Our smile is related to many things including the size and shape of the teeth, the color of the teeth, the amount of teeth that shows when smiling or talking, the loss of any teeth, the types of old restorations in the teeth, etc.</p>

						<p>After analyzing the problem, possible treatment options can include reshaping of the teeth, whitening the teeth by bleaching, straightening the teeth, restoring the teeth with white fillings, crowns, veneers, replacing missing teeth with implants, bridges, or dentures, and gingival alterations to give a balanced, well-sculpted gum line. </p>
