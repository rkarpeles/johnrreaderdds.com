				<h3>Interests and Hobbies</h3>
				<h5 class="serif"><em>1. Home remodeling</em></h5>
				<p>I have done a considerable amount of home remodeling, including finishing basements, trim carpentry, hardwood floors, tiling, etc. Perhaps the joy of working with my hands comes from being the son of a cement contractor, the grandson of a mechanic, and the great grandson of a carpenter.</p>

				<h5 class="serif"><em>2. Genealogy</em></h5>
				<p>My wife Ali and I have spent many years researching our genealogies. We use our free time and vacation time to do online research as well as traveling to our ancestors' homelands. We spend time in courthouses and libraries, poring over old records, as well as traipsing through sometimes old and overgrown cemeteries in search of our ancestors. We have become very successful at this and have helped others get started on their family histories.</p>

				<h5 class="serif"><em>3. Art</em></h5>
				<p>My interest in art was founded in my mother's and grandmother's interest in art. Encouraged by seeing my brother Allan create some beautiful paintings, and enhanced by visiting some of the great art museums, curiosity finally got the best of me and I purchased some supplies, picked up a brush, and tried to see if I could paint.</p> 
				<p>My initial reaction was a definite "No". But I read books, practiced a lot and started to get better results. I also received hours of enjoyment painting at home and outdoors.</p> 
				<p>While painting, one looks at the world differently, observing much more than one normally would, and appreciating the beauty of light, color, and form in the natural world. It comes as no surprise that these skills are also useful in the art of cosmetic dentistry as well.</p>
